                p The universe of the 
                    span.light Game of Life
                    |  is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, 
                    span.light alive or dead
                    |  , or "populated" 	or "unpopulated" (the difference may seem minor, except when viewing it as an early model of human/urban behavior simulation or how one views a blank space on a grid). Every cell interacts with its 
                    span.light eight neighbours
                    | , which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
                p - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
                p - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
                p - Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.
                p - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
