Every cell interacts with its <span class="light">eight neighbours</span>, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:</p><p>- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.</p><p>- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</p><p>- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.</p><p>- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</p><footer>Website by <a href="http://freecodecamp.com/Cinders-P">Cinders-P</a></footer></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="game"></div></div><script src="tile.js"></script><script src="board.js"></script><script src="controls.js"></script><script src="container.js"></script></div></body></html>
